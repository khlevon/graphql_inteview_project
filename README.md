# This is a simple project which provides a GraphQL API to add a city into a database and get an hourly weather forecast for it.

# What is your task?

1. You need to setup project in your local environment
2. You need to read and understand the code
3. You need to create a new GraphQL type called `Weather` based on the type definitions in `src/app/db/models/weather.ts`
4. You need to create a new GraphQL query called `weatherForCities` which will get list of city ids and return a list of `Weather` objects
5. You need to implement the `src/workers/dataSync.ts` worker which will fetch weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for each existing city in database by given interval and update the `Weather` objects in database with that data

│── dist/               # Compiled JavaScript code goes here (DON'T WRITE CODE HERE)
```

### Getting started the development process

1. Install Dependencies (run script in the root directory)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create environment configs

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   ```

3. Run docker services

   - For initialize

   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file ./.env.development up -d --build
   ```

   - For destroy

   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file ./.env.development down
   ```

   - For development start/stop

   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file ./.env.development start -d
   ```

   and

   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file ./.env.development stop -d
   ```

   - To see app logs

   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file ./.env.development logs -f app
   ```

4. Run the development server

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```
